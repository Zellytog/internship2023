# internship2023

This is the repo I use to keep the agda code of my internship of 2023, at Chalmers, under the supervision of Thierry Coquand, between 29/04 and 29/07.
The goal is to formalise a construction of the sign of a permutation using univalence.

## Structure of the code

1. Construction of the type of Z/2Z-torsors (which will be called 2-torsors)

2. Construction of the category **Ab** as a category of homogeneous connected pointed groupoids and definition of the n-ary biproduct in this category

3. Construction of the orientation of a finite set by combining the previous two constructions

4. Definition of the sign of a permutation
